# My Projects

## Tire Defect Detection
Built a real-time tire defect detection system using deep learning techniques.  
The system used the YOLOv8 algorithm, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to detect defects such as cuts, bead damage, and bulges on tires from images captured in real time.
